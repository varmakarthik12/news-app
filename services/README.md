## Services Folder

The `services` folder contains service modules responsible for handling API calls and business logic. These modules are designed to be reusable and encapsulate the core functionality of the application.

### Folder Structure

- **services/**
  - **news/**: Contains modules related to fetching and processing news data.
    - [`news.ts`](services/news/news.ts): Module for fetching news articles from external APIs.

### Collaboration Guide
